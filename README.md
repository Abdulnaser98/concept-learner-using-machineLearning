#### Abstract

> Concept learning algorithms play a major role in learning new concepts to predict the out-comes of future inputs.  This study presents a website that can generate 
the version space boundariesregarding a submitted training data set. The algorithm used in the background is the candidate elimination algorithm. 
The algorithm iterates over the list of the training in-stances and by the end it produces the final border sets of the version space. 
The website pro-vides the user with an interactive interface and enables him/her to either submitting the train-ing records directly to the website by creating 
a training table or uploading the training table from his/her machine. It uses state-of-the-art JavaScript libraries to automatically process the data set submitted by the user. Different programming and script languages are used to achieve the functionality of the website and make it responsive on all devices regardless of what their operating system they use or what the size of their screen is. The special focus is on JavaScript to achieve the functionality of the website and on Html, CSS, Bootstrap to achieve the responsiveness of it
